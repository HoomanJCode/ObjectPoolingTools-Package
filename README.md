# ObjectPoolingTools-Package
This is my simple UnityGameEngine pooling and object management tool and I want to share it with my friends.
You can create a pool from an object and use them in easy way.
### to do that:
0. Import Package from Unity Package Manager by selecting ``` Add package from git URL... ```
1. Create pool by ```ObjectPool<Type> Name``` and use that. Attention to example.

# Example
```csharp

//soon...


```
